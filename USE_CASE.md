# AppDynamics Monitoring Extension for Redis Enterprise
 
Redis Enterprise Software is from Redis Labs which enhances the open-source Redis with multiple deployment choices (public and private clouds, on-premises, hybrid, RAM-Flash combination), topology and support for very large data-set sizes. The AppDynamics Monitoring Extension for Redis Enterprise will collect metrics from Redis Enterprise clusters and send them to AppDynamics Controller.
